### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rob

I'm a Principal Software Engineer at ASOS, working with distributed, high-scale systems and the people who build them.

Find my personal projects over on [@robbell][github-robbell], including [architecture visualisation][c4-diagrams], [static-site generation][hi-blog], [.NET templates for Kubernetes][k8s-template] and [games development][7drl].

I also occasionally write at [robbell.io][website].

ðŸ‘€ Feel free to look around.
